        <p>Yes, it’s really that important. Although wireframes, mockups, and prototypes may seem similar, they all serve a unique role at distinct times during the product development lifecycle. Wireframing, mockuping, and prototyping are processes in the early stages of product development, especially the web, mobile, and native applications.</p>

    <p>It can help you visualize how your product will look and work before you start building it. This article explains the differences between them in details and help you understand when a wireframe, prototype and mockup should be used in the design process. Although wireframes, mockups, and prototypes may seem similar, they all serve a unique role at distinct times during the product development lifecycle.</p>
        <h3>A Wireframe Is A Quick Sketch Of A Product Intended To Convey Its Desired Functionalities.</h3>

    <p>It is similar to a wireframe such that both are static and do not focus on the interaction with users. A mockup typically includes additional visual details such as: A mockup is a static wireframe that includes more stylistic and visual ui details to present a realistic model of what the final page or application will look like.</p>
        <h3>In Other Words, The Mockup Looks Exactly Like The.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Here, the design should represent the structure of the information and basic ways of users&#039; interaction with the interface. Mockups can be as simple as sketches on paper or as detailed as interactive prototypes. However, the mockup lacks interactivity, which means nothing is clickable on it.</p>
        <h3>Presentation For Team Members Or Clients To Visualize Your Project;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A mockup is a page or screen of the finished application design, as it will look to the user. It tells you what the app will do, but not how it will look. A mockup is a visual way of representing a product.</p>
