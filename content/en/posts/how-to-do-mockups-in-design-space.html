    <p>How to create a mockup in cricut design space start by logging in to cricut design space and creating or uploading a design for your project on a blank canvas. A new window will open. The reasons for this are many, but one main reason for creating a mockup is to make your designs, illustrations, or anything you want to show off look more realistic.</p>
        <h3>In The Drop Down Box Select Unmodified.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The solution to the problem is to create the mockups directly in the cricut and/or silhouette software. A mockup comes after a wireframe in the design process, and it builds upon the design of the wireframe. Click on the open icon.</p>
        <h3>A Mockup Is A Full Rendering Of Your Design On One Or More Of The Client’s Products Like Labels, Business Cards, Stationery And Signage.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Select “complex” as the image type, then hot continue. Adjust the perspective to match the rest of the scene. Upload a blank mockup template for your project.</p>
        <h3>Open The Project In Design Space That You Want To Create Your Mockup For.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Have the shape you’d like to fill to print in a new cricut design space file. That&#039;s the smart object layer which can be double clicked to edit the image. Design elements are the parts of the app or website which establish how it looks and feels.</p>
        <h3>Draw A Shape To Insert The Mockup Content.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>You can draw it or use a photo. Start by creating a new file with the size that suits your needs. Upload a blank mockup template for your project.</p>
