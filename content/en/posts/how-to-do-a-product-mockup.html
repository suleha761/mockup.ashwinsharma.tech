        <h3>If You Want To Use Your Mockup In A New Design, Click Use In A Design.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Start by logging in to your canva account and click to create a new design, or choose one of the options from the default image sizes. Three easy steps to your first mockup. Create logo mockups, business cards, and branding assets in a few minutes right from your browser.</p>
        <h3>You Can Download A Free Trial Of Adobe Photoshop, Along With Sample Assets To Practice With.</h3>

    <p>Create designs with several layers. First off, you’ll need to take a screenshot of the page you want to show in your mockup. You can choose any size you want.</p>
        <h3>Your Products Deserve The Best Demonstration.</h3>

    <p>Save the file and, voila, you have a product mockup. Open your snipping tool (if you’re not sure what or where that is i show you how to find it in the video or you can use your pc search bar to locate it.) and take a snippit of your newly mocked up product. So, it is often used at a later design stage to better demonstrate design ideas.</p>
        <h3>Forget About Spending Hours Learning How To Use Photoshop.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Click upload screenshot and select the image you want to place on the product. However, without any interactions or transitions, it only looks like the final product, and cannot be interacted with as you do with the real product. Pick the mockup you want to use.</p>

    <br/>
