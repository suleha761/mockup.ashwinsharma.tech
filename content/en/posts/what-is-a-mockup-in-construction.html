        <h3>A Mockup Is A Visual Way Of Representing A Product.</h3>

        <h3>Mock Ups Are Used To Set Quality Of Work Standards.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Simply put, a mockup in construction is a physical sample of some kind that’s meant to represent a portion of the finished construction project. Most mockup test procedures begin with opening, closing and locking all operable elements. Mockups are sample panels made using the same materials, techniques, and personnel that will be used on the project.</p>
        <h3>Without The Option To See The Actual Building Components In Place, There’s Always The Chance The Final Product Won’t Align With Our Owner’s Expectations.</h3>
