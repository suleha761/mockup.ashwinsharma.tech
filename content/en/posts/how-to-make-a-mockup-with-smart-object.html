        <h3>Now That Your Item Is Placed, It’s Time To Save Your Smart Object.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Open the file and pass on to the design layer. But i can&#039;t figure out how they make this product and turned it into a 3d smart object? You can transform the text without doing that, but you don&#039;t have as many transform options.</p>
        <h3>Simple Edit With Smart Layers.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Open your smart object layer in a new tab by double clicking on the smart object layer icon. If you simply double click on the layer itself, this won’t work. In this step, we create the shape layer to conform to the object we are mocking up, and convert the shape to a smart object layer.</p>
        <h3>Once You Have The Text In The Smart Object, Select Edit&gt;Transform&gt;Distort.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Double click on the layer icon. Designscape will tell you at the top that the smart object has been updated. Here is the mockup, with all the smart objects clipped to their respective screens:</p>
        <h3>Create Professional Mockups Right Inside Your Browser, Even On The Go.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Make sure that the additional options of the layer are enabled (a tiny arrow on the right). Click the load action and navigate to the downloaded mockups.atn file. Once you are done with editing, we need to save the smart object.</p>
        <h3>It Might Not Be As Hard As You Think.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Most mockups come with three different file types, psd, png and jpg. Want a super speedy mockup of your website on all devices. Your smart object will open in a new tab, where you can now drop in your design.</p>
