        <h3>Increase The Size Of Your Pattern To At Least Cover The Size Of Your Tote Bag.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The first step in learning how to create mockups is to go to placeit.net and navigate to the mockups tab. Find and download you will find plenty of psd mockup files to work with around the web — this includes both free and paid items. Now it’s time to add your actual product image to the mockup.</p>
        <h3>Select A Grid + Place It Over Your Screen.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jpeg file ‒ the preview of the template in action. Select “complex” as the image type, then hot continue. If you want to use your mockup in a new design, click use in a design.</p>
        <h3>So, Make Sure You Choose The Image That Add An Extra Element To Your Mockup Design.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Your app ui mockup is done! Click the load action and navigate to the downloaded mockups.atn file. Notice that the file has multiple layers and this easily accommodates the process of updating the file to include your own custom imagery.</p>
        <h3>This Will Preserve Your Original Image’s Source Content, Allowing You To Easily Substitute One Design For Another And Reuse Your Mockup Template For Future Projects.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Like you did before, you’ll use the “magnetic lasso” tool to select whatever part of the mockup image you want the design featured on and drag your artwork into photoshop. Make the adjustments then click on save. Once you upload your image on the adobe photoshop website mockup tool, then it&#039;s time to give a shape to the image.</p>
        <h3>If The Design Has Multiple Pages, Click On The Thumbnail Of The Page You Want To Use.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Your products deserve the best demonstration. Try the custom mockup maker for 14 days at no extra charge as part of printful plus or printful pro. Liven up the mockups with 100+ design elements.</p>
